# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Analysis

### Purpose
  For this project, our client has just come off of a succesful run of the play *Fever* where fundraising goals were met quickly. They want to understand how their play performed compared to others, and identify any indicators of success for future endeavors. The purpose of this analysis is to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Visualizations were used to further understand and summarize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Election-Audit Summary

- In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

     To expand the analysis of Outcome Based on Goals, It would be interesting to bring in the pledged data to better understand the outcomes quantitatively and not just whether the play was successful. You could update the table to have average % pledged (compared to goal) and have that on the y axis with a separate line for failed and successful. It would also be valuable to combine these two analysis and visualize Pledged or Goal amount vs Launch date.
