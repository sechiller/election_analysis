# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Analysis

### Purpose
  For this project, the election commission has requested election audit results. They are hoping to view the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total county and the county with the highest turnout. The goal of this project is to update the code to include additional for loops and conditional statements that find the requested data. The data then has to be printed and saved to a file. 

## Election-Audit Results

* 369,711 votes were cast in this congressional election
* County Summary:
   * Jeffersion: 38,855 votes (10.5%)
   * Denver: 306,055 votes (82.8%)
   * Arapahoe: 24,801 votes (6.7%)

## Election-Audit Summary

This election script can easily be used - with slight modifications - to summarize election data for any type of election. For example, if this was a city election instead of a county election, the code could be easily updated by replacing the word "county" with "city". You would only need to verify that the city name was in the second column of the provided data - or make a small update to the code to refer to the correct column. Similarily you could update the code for a election for a local bill instead of a candidate. You would only need to replace the word "candidate" with "bill" in the code, and verify that the bill name was in the third column of the provided data - or make a small update to the code to refer to the correct column.
